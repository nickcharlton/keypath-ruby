# keypath-based collection access extensions for Ruby.

[![Tests](https://github.com/nickcharlton/keypath-ruby/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nickcharlton/keypath-ruby/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

This gem allows you to access nested Ruby collections (`Hash`, `Array`, etc) using
keypaths.

For example, say you had a nested data structure like:

```ruby
data = {
    :item_one => {:id => 1, :url => 'http://nickcharlton.net/'},
    :something_else => [
        {
            :id => 1,
            :url => 'https://github.com/'
        }
    ]
}
```

You could access "https://github.com/" through: `something_else.0.url`. Basically,
this is intended to allow you to manipulate/transform large nested structures that
you might get back from a JSON document.

## Installation

`keypath-ruby` is on [RubyGems][] as `key_path`. But you can also add the repo
to your [Gemfile][]:

```ruby
gem 'key_path', :git => 'https://github.com/nickcharlton/keypath-ruby.git'
```

## Usage

`KeyPath` is at least two things. First, it's a class (actually, `KeyPath::Path`)
which represents a path (this is just a string, and has methods to go back and
forth from it) and secondly a set of class extensions for `Enumerable`, `Hash` and
`String` which allow you to use the native collection classes with keypaths.

```ruby
require 'key_path'

data = {
    :item => {
        :url => 'http://nickcharlton.net'
    }
}

# fetching a path
path = KeyPath::Path.new 'item.url'
data.value_at_keypath(path) #=> 'http://nickcharlton.net'

# finding all `:url` paths in a collection
data.keypaths_for_nested_key(:url) #=> {item.url => 'http://nickcharlton.net'}

# going back and forth from a string
path.to_s #=> 'item.url'
'item.url'.to_keypath #=> #<KeyPath:70096895112220 path=item.url>

# get the parent of a keypath (or nil, if there isn't one)
path.parent #=> #<KeyPath:70096895221110 path=item>

# setting a path
data.set_keypath(path, 'http://github.com/')
```
